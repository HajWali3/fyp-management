## üìù Brief Introduction

The FYP Management System is a role-based platform where:

- Students can submit project proposals, upload reports, and receive feedback.
- Supervisors can review proposals, provide comments, and assign grades.
- Admins can manage users, oversee project statuses, and generate reports.

This system improves transparency, reduces paperwork, and tracks progress from project proposal to final evaluation.
